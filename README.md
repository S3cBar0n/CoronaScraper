<h1>CoronaScraper</h1>
<h3>Voice activated Web Scraper on Coronavirus statistic in total and by country.</h3>

To keep my API keys safe; to use this scraper you will need to create a ParseHub account and scrape your own stastics from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/

This scraper uses your microphone and the use of key words to trigger commands and pull statistics.

<h4>Saying these words in any sentance will trigger commands:</h4>
"total" and "cases" = Total cases worldwide.<br>
"total" and "deaths" = Total deaths worldwide.<br>
"total" and "recovered" = Total recovered worldwide.<br><br>
And adding your country of choice into the sentance will provide country specific stats.<br><br>

Saying "update" will update the current statistics.<br>
Saying "stop" will shut the webscaper down.
